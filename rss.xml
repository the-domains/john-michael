            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Apple Challenges Government Demand To Crack Drug Dealer's iPhone In New York</h1><p>Apple has formally challenged the U.S. Department of Justice over another locked iPhone and the encrypted information it contains.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Ars VR headset showdown-Oculus Rift vs. HTC Vive</h1><p>In our original reviews of the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive, we tried very hard to examine these virtual reality systems on their own merits without constant comparisons to the competition. But no product exists in a vacuum. After years of buildup, we're now faced with two competitive, PC-tethered VR headsets hitting the market right next to each other.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a473611978ca4931a0d74678d9cd4a6eaafdb8a9.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Partly, this is because of raw technology--Tesla's is clearly superior to that of its competitors. Partly, it's because Tesla has a more efficient business model. As Slate recently pointed out, Tesla bypasses value-subtracting dealer franchises and universally disliked car salespeople.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/967786c4c9a099ae3d4e342800c9901098d0268b.jpg"></article>]]></description>
